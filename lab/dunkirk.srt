2
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,146
English! I'm English!

3
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:41,795
It's grenadiers, mate.

4
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:56,912
Make way!

5
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:02,344
Out of the way!

6
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:04,022
Go, go, go!

7
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:06,322
Along the mole. All the way.

8
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:08,322
The ship's about to leave.

9
00:06:09,362 --> 00:06:11,489
Along the mole. All the way.
The ship's about to leave.

10
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,616
Where's the bloody air force?

11
00:08:35,007 --> 00:08:37,339
The navy's requisitioned her.

12
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,445
They'll be back in an hour.
My dad wants to be ready before then.

13
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:45,143
They've told us to strip her
and load those life jackets.

14
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:48,182
Some men across the Channel,
at Dunkirk, need taking off.

15
00:08:48,554 --> 00:08:49,612
Some men?

16
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:11,868
Check fuel, Fortis 1 and 2.

17
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,172
70 gallons.

18
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:21,383
68 gallons, Fortis Leader.

19
00:09:22,254 --> 00:09:24,744
Stay down at 500 feet to leave fuel

20
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:27,486
for 40-minute fighting time over Dunkirk.

21
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:31,095
Understood. Vector 128, angels point five.

22
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:34,431
And keep an eye on that gauge,
even when it gets lively.

23
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,534
Save enough to get back.

24
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:49,005
No French soldiers. No French soldiers. No.

25
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:52,542
No, no French. English only.
English only past this point.

26
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:55,145
No. It's a British ship.
No, you have your own ships.

27
00:10:55,314 --> 00:10:56,906
Get back. Get back.

28
00:10:57,082 --> 00:10:59,175
No, you've got your own ships.
This is a British ship.

29
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:00,682
No, get back.

30
00:11:00,853 --> 00:11:02,753
Look, get the stretchers through.
There are stretchers coming.

31
00:11:02,922 --> 00:11:04,913
Get out of the way! Out of the way!

32
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,025
Go, go, go. Along the mole. All the way.

33
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,628
The ship's about to leave. About to leave.

34
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:11,820
Along the mole. All the way.

35
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,261
Along the mole. Along the mole.
All the way. All the way.

36
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,489
No.

37
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:18,398
No, English only. English only!

38
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,429
No!

39
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,188
Ready on the stern!

40
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:40,347
Yes, sir!

41
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,137
Man the bowline!

42
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:54,704
Any more room?

43
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:03,909
You have to get back!

44
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:13,247
That's two minutes.

45
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:15,393
You've missed it. You've missed it.

46
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:44,645
Is that the last one?

47
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,248
Aye, sir.

48
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:50,252
Break the line.

49
00:12:54,033 --> 00:12:55,398
Come on! Come on!

50
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,315
Dunkirk's so far.
Why can't they just load at Calais?

51
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:56,984
The enemy had something to say about it.

52
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,695
Ah, down here we're sitting ducks.

53
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,528
Keep 'em peeled. They'll come out of the sun.

54
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:18,338
Up the line.

55
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,384
Oi. We'll take it.

56
00:14:24,723 --> 00:14:26,156
Drop the gangplank!

57
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,314
Yes, sir!

58
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,738
Take a run at it.

59
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,541
Ready on the stern line, George.

60
00:15:20,245 --> 00:15:21,769
Aren't you waiting on the navy?

61
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,981
They've asked for the Moonstone,
they'll have her.

62
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:25,343
And her captain.

63
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:27,712
And his son.

64
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,946
Thanks for the help, George.

65
00:15:35,527 --> 00:15:36,994
What are you doing?

66
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:38,356
You do know where we're going?

67
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,188
France.

68
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,133
Into war, George.

69
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,398
I'll be useful, sir.

70
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,447
Bandit, 11 o'clock.

71
00:15:57,449 --> 00:15:58,643
Break.

72
00:16:12,197 --> 00:16:13,186
He's on me.

73
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:16,898
I'm on him.

74
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:55,039
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight...

75
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,229
Oi, you two.

76
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:57,806
Get a shift on.

77
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,345
Yeah, pull him tight. Tie a knot in it.

78
00:17:02,514 --> 00:17:04,448
Back up the line. Both of you.

79
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:06,015
Off you go.

80
00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:07,345
Off you go!

81
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,851
That last barrage has damaged the rudder.

82
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:11,349
Uh, okay...

83
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,818
Psst!

84
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:50,750
Mr. Dawson!

85
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:52,294
One of ours, George.

86
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:04,628
On my mark, Fortis 2. Draw him left.

87
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:08,602
Three, two, one.

88
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,165
Mark.

89
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,514
Clear.

90
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,655
Is he down?

91
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:40,533
Yeah, he's down for the count.

92
00:19:47,012 --> 00:19:49,207
Fortis Leader, one bandit down.

93
00:19:54,252 --> 00:19:55,742
Fortis Leader, do you read?

94
00:20:00,726 --> 00:20:04,287
Fortis 2, I have you to my port.
I have no eyes on Fortis Leader. Over.

95
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:06,556
Understood, Fortis 1.

96
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:08,165
Orbit for a look.

97
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:22,141
How long, Lieutenant?

98
00:20:22,314 --> 00:20:25,374
We need to run a new cable, sir.
They're scrambling.

99
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,847
Very well.

100
00:20:31,623 --> 00:20:34,558
Colonel, you're gonna have to decide
how many more wounded to evacuate.

101
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:37,320
One stretcher takes the space
of seven standing men.

102
00:20:37,496 --> 00:20:38,554
Excuse me.

103
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,709
- Rear Admiral.
- Commander.

104
00:20:57,282 --> 00:20:58,647
How's the perimeter?

105
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,340
Shrinking every day.

106
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:03,584
But between our rear guard
and the French, we're holding the line.

107
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:05,920
And the enemy tanks have stopped.

108
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,456
Why have they stopped?

109
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,089
Waste precious tanks when they can pick us
off from the air, like fish in a barrel?

110
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:14,289
How long does London expect the army
to hold out before we make terms?

111
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:15,455
Make terms?

112
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:19,467
They're not stopping here.
We need to get our army back.

113
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,767
Britain's next
and then the rest of the world.

114
00:21:22,941 --> 00:21:24,033
Christ.

115
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,370
I mean, you can practically see it from here.

116
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:28,638
What?

117
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:30,809
Home.

118
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,544
What about the French?

119
00:21:33,718 --> 00:21:36,050
Publicly, Churchill's told them,
"Bras dessous."

120
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:38,212
Arm in arm, leaving together.

121
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:39,617
And privately?

122
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,281
We need our army back.

123
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,919
How many men are they talking about, sir?

124
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,422
Churchill wants 30,000.
Ramsay's hoping we can give him 45.

125
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:52,265
There are 400,000 men on this beach, sir.

126
00:21:53,238 --> 00:21:55,331
We'll just have to do our best.

127
00:21:56,508 --> 00:21:59,068
Right, well, this mole stays open
at all costs.

128
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,237
We're in artillery range from the west.
If anything else sinks here,

129
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:06,407
the mole's blocked and we're stuffed.

130
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:08,109
Can't we load from the beaches?

131
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:09,810
Better than standing out here
when the dive bombs come.

132
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:11,353
- It's impossible.
- Too shallow?

133
00:22:11,523 --> 00:22:13,423
'Cause anything that drafts
over three feet can't get near.

134
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:16,652
We don't have enough small boats
to ferry men to the destroyers.

135
00:22:17,195 --> 00:22:20,096
The mole it is, then, gentlemen.

136
00:23:09,548 --> 00:23:10,572
Hey!

137
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,711
Hey! Can you swim it?

138
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:16,914
Dad, can you get closer?

139
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,156
Can't risk it!

140
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:21,714
Hang on.

141
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,571
What's your name?

142
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,092
Wreckage below.

143
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,062
Is it more of the 109?

144
00:24:36,201 --> 00:24:37,395
No.

145
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:39,330
It's Fortis Leader. Over.

146
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:41,828
You think he got out?

147
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,062
I didn't see a 'chute.

148
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:46,811
Record his position.

149
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:51,212
Then set heading 128, height 1,000. Over.

150
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,475
Vector 128, angels one. Understood.

151
00:24:59,524 --> 00:25:00,855
Fortis 2, what's your fuel?

152
00:25:02,227 --> 00:25:03,353
50 gallons. Over.

153
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:06,194
50 gallons.

154
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,768
All right, keep letting me know.

155
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,699
My gauge took a bit of a knock back there.

156
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,796
Shouldn't you turn back?

157
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,465
No, no.

158
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,476
I'm fairly confident it's just the gauge.

159
00:26:50,702 --> 00:26:52,727
- She's going down!
- Cut her loose!

160
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:53,962
What about the wounded?

161
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:57,639
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

162
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:01,477
Cut her loose, and push her off!

163
00:27:01,646 --> 00:27:03,409
We can't let her sink at the mole!

164
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:05,946
Push the bloody boat off!

165
00:27:13,424 --> 00:27:14,413
Help us!

166
00:28:27,732 --> 00:28:29,597
Do you want to come below?

167
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,701
It's much warmer.

168
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:33,798
It's out of the wind.

169
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:35,371
Here you go.

170
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:39,668
Leave him be, George.

171
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,675
He feels safer on deck.

172
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,241
You would too if you'd been bombed.

173
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:45,404
U-boat.

174
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,916
It was a U-boat.

175
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,155
Get him some more tea, George.

176
00:29:10,174 --> 00:29:14,271
Right, we're about five minutes out,
so climb to 2,000. Over.

177
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:15,571
That's more fuel.

178
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:17,237
I know, but I don't want to get jumped again.

179
00:29:17,448 --> 00:29:18,437
Let's get a decent altitude.

180
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:20,550
We can dive down on the bastards
from above. Over.

181
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,208
Understood. Angels two.

182
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:23,376
Over.

183
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,879
Right, Highlanders.

184
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:29,017
Let's find you another ship.

185
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,121
Come on.

186
00:30:45,136 --> 00:30:47,696
Everyone else, keep climbing.
Climb on the deck.

187
00:30:48,272 --> 00:30:51,002
Climb on the deck.

188
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:53,534
Watch your heads on the rail. Watch it.

189
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,110
That's right, keep going down.
Take a blanket.

190
00:30:57,281 --> 00:30:58,373
Down you go. Put this on, my love.

191
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:02,050
Down you go. Keep going down.

192
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,347
There's a nice cup of tea for you down there.

193
00:31:04,522 --> 00:31:05,511
Keep moving down.

194
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:07,351
Take a blanket.

195
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:09,548
Try and make some room.

196
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,160
Keep moving down, boys.

197
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,555
This way.

198
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:16,291
A cup of tea down there.

199
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:43,960
There you go. Down there. Move down there.

200
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:04,681
What's wrong with your friend?

201
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:25,263
He's looking for a quick way out.

202
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:29,104
In case we go down.

203
00:33:07,645 --> 00:33:09,078
Where are we going?

204
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:10,737
Dunkirk.

205
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,842
No, uh, no, no, we're going to England.

206
00:33:16,587 --> 00:33:18,578
We have to go to Dunkirk first.

207
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,921
Look, I'm not going back.

208
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:24,851
I'm not going back.

209
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,127
Look at it.

210
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:29,993
If we go there, we'll die.

211
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:38,164
I see your point, son.

212
00:33:39,043 --> 00:33:41,136
Well, let's plot a course.

213
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,144
You can take your tea below and warm up.

214
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,314
Peter, have we got space
for a man to lie down?

215
00:33:52,456 --> 00:33:53,855
Uh, yeah.

216
00:33:59,263 --> 00:34:00,662
Here, come on.

217
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:07,026
Careful.

218
00:34:09,473 --> 00:34:10,633
Careful.

219
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:18,243
Just in there.

220
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,483
I'll get you some more tea.

221
00:34:37,235 --> 00:34:38,759
Is he a coward, Mr. Dawson?

222
00:34:38,936 --> 00:34:40,563
He's shell-shocked, George.

223
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:42,296
He's not himself.

224
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:47,442
He may never be himself again.

225
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,214
Here you are.

226
00:35:14,772 --> 00:35:16,706
40 gallons, Fortis 1.

227
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,334
40 gallons, understood.

228
00:35:23,514 --> 00:35:24,981
Heinkel, 11 o'clock.

229
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,317
She's lining up to drop her load
on that minesweeper.

230
00:35:28,486 --> 00:35:29,475
Fighters?

231
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:32,122
Yeah, 109s off her starboard.

232
00:35:33,224 --> 00:35:34,657
I'm on the bomber.

233
00:36:26,477 --> 00:36:27,466
Got him! Got him!

234
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:01,607
Oh, she's turning. You must've damaged her.

235
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:03,206
Where's the escort?

236
00:37:03,381 --> 00:37:04,541
Well, I got one of...

237
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:06,205
Jesus!

238
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:26,263
I'm going down.

239
00:37:26,437 --> 00:37:27,995
I'm on him. Bail out.

240
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:49,591
No, the swell looks good. I'm ditching.

241
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:14,308
- Don't leave us!
- Come back!

242
00:38:14,852 --> 00:38:17,377
- Wait for us!
- Help! Help us!

243
00:38:20,224 --> 00:38:23,625
Pick us up! Pick us up!

244
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:28,798
Come back!

245
00:38:30,568 --> 00:38:31,762
Torpedo!

246
00:39:03,033 --> 00:39:06,992
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

247
00:40:53,544 --> 00:40:54,738
Help!

248
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:56,573
Get us out of here!

249
00:41:11,295 --> 00:41:12,592
Spitfires, George.

250
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:15,095
Greatest plane ever built.

251
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:19,925
You didn't even look.

252
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:23,273
Rolls-Royce Merlin engines.

253
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:27,305
Sweetest sound you could hear out here.

254
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,101
Hello?

255
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:32,772
Could you open the door?

256
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,474
Hello? Can you hear me?

257
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,318
Open the door!

258
00:41:38,756 --> 00:41:40,121
Do you hear me?

259
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,756
He wants to come out.

260
00:41:43,927 --> 00:41:45,918
What have you done? Locked him in?

261
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:47,586
Let him out, for God's sake.

262
00:41:47,765 --> 00:41:48,754
Hello?

263
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:52,362
Let me out!

264
00:42:06,884 --> 00:42:09,352
You haven't turned around.

265
00:42:11,955 --> 00:42:13,718
No. We have a job to do.

266
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:18,353
Job? This is a pleasure yacht.

267
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:21,226
You're weekend sailors, not the bloody navy.

268
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:23,526
A man your age?

269
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,469
Men my age dictate this war.

270
00:42:26,637 --> 00:42:29,333
Why should we be allowed
to send our children to fight it?

271
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,261
You should be at home!

272
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:35,004
Well, there won't be any home if we
allow a slaughter across the Channel.

273
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:43,679
He's turning tail. I'm gonna get after him.

274
00:42:45,689 --> 00:42:46,678
Good luck.

275
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:49,849
Watch your fuel. You're at 15 gallons.

276
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:53,929
15 gallons, understood.

277
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:57,591
Best of luck, Collins.

278
00:43:00,671 --> 00:43:02,832
Collins, do you read?

279
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:06,796
Oi! No! No!

280
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,665
Get off! Get off!

281
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:11,070
Piss off, the both of you. It's too crowded.

282
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:12,469
You can't leave us!

283
00:44:13,544 --> 00:44:14,602
Make some room!

284
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:15,767
No!

285
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,977
No! Get off!

286
00:44:18,148 --> 00:44:19,513
You men, leave off. You'll capsize the boat.

287
00:44:19,683 --> 00:44:21,844
She's gone over twice on the way out here.

288
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,611
You have to stay calm.
There are plenty of boats.

289
00:44:23,821 --> 00:44:24,810
Calm?

290
00:44:24,988 --> 00:44:27,252
Wait till you get torpedoed,
then tell us to be calm!

291
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,088
You have life jackets?

292
00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:30,556
Yes, they do.

293
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:33,955
Don't panic, boys. The water's
not too rough or too cold.

294
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:35,655
We're heading back to the beach.

295
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,097
- Let's go to Dover!
- Yeah!

296
00:44:38,836 --> 00:44:40,497
We can't make it across the Channel
in this, lads.

297
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:44,129
We need to get back to the beach
and wait for another ride.

298
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:47,272
You men in the water, float here,
save your strength.

299
00:44:47,444 --> 00:44:48,968
We'll come back for you.

300
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:50,135
Oars in!

301
00:44:51,281 --> 00:44:53,977
Together, pull!

302
00:44:55,252 --> 00:44:57,516
Together, pull!

303
00:44:59,857 --> 00:45:00,846
Pull!

304
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:04,053
Together, pull!

305
00:45:06,296 --> 00:45:07,320
Pull!

306
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:11,367
Together, pull!

307
00:45:14,605 --> 00:45:16,800
There's no hiding from this, son.

308
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:21,738
What is it you think you can do
out there, on this thing?

309
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:25,073
There's not just us. A call went out.

310
00:45:25,249 --> 00:45:27,308
We aren't the only ones to answer, you know.

311
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:29,145
You don't even have guns.

312
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:30,508
Do you have a gun?

313
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,417
Yes, of course. A rifle, a 303.

314
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,616
Did it help you against the dive bombers
and the U-boats?

315
00:45:37,861 --> 00:45:39,522
You're an old fool.

316
00:45:40,731 --> 00:45:42,562
I'm not going back.

317
00:45:43,166 --> 00:45:44,394
I'm not going back.

318
00:45:45,102 --> 00:45:46,091
Turn it around.

319
00:45:47,204 --> 00:45:48,603
I'm not turning round.

320
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:50,433
Turn it around!

321
00:45:52,209 --> 00:45:53,403
Turn it...

322
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:56,879
- Calm it down, mate.
- Turn it around!

323
00:45:57,047 --> 00:45:58,036
Wait, wait!

324
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,614
Calm it down, mate.

325
00:46:01,084 --> 00:46:02,073
George?

326
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,909
George!

327
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:07,712
What have you done?

328
00:46:09,426 --> 00:46:10,893
Okay, you're all right, George.

329
00:46:11,628 --> 00:46:12,788
You're all right.

330
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,522
Hang on. Okay. Okay, just...

331
00:46:16,667 --> 00:46:18,191
That's it. That's good enough.

332
00:46:18,368 --> 00:46:21,269
It's gonna keep some pressure on.
There we go.

333
00:46:21,438 --> 00:46:23,030
There we go.

334
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:24,434
Can you hear me, George?

335
00:48:58,995 --> 00:49:00,485
Come on, lads!

336
00:49:01,765 --> 00:49:04,598
Come on! Come on, boys!

337
00:51:10,093 --> 00:51:11,253
It's a pier.

338
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:13,920
For when the water comes in.

339
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:19,866
The tide's turning now.

340
00:51:21,938 --> 00:51:22,927
How can you tell?

341
00:51:25,408 --> 00:51:26,875
The bodies come back.

342
00:51:57,707 --> 00:51:58,696
Hey.

343
00:52:11,054 --> 00:52:12,715
Hey, Highlanders!

344
00:52:22,632 --> 00:52:24,293
Hey, Highlanders!

345
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:25,661
What's that way?

346
00:52:26,169 --> 00:52:27,158
A boat.

347
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,259
She's grounded.

348
00:52:29,072 --> 00:52:31,131
Not when the tide comes in, she's not.

349
00:52:48,425 --> 00:52:51,019
Be a brave lad.

350
00:52:53,563 --> 00:52:55,030
You and Mr. Dawson?

351
00:52:57,133 --> 00:52:58,361
It's the best thing I've ever done.

352
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:01,702
You're all right. You're okay.

353
00:53:12,782 --> 00:53:15,273
Sea Cadet.
It's the only thing I've ever done.

354
00:53:15,452 --> 00:53:17,579
It's all right. It's okay.
Just have some water.

355
00:53:20,457 --> 00:53:22,118
I told my dad...

356
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:24,453
I've done nothing at school

357
00:53:26,363 --> 00:53:28,524
and that I would do something one day.

358
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,802
Maybe get in the local paper.

359
00:53:34,037 --> 00:53:36,232
Maybe my teachers would see it.

360
00:53:36,406 --> 00:53:37,964
Okay, get some rest.

361
00:53:38,608 --> 00:53:41,133
I need you back up on deck
as soon as you're able.

362
00:53:42,412 --> 00:53:43,401
I can't.

363
00:53:44,147 --> 00:53:45,671
What?

364
00:53:49,586 --> 00:53:50,917
I can't see.

365
00:54:50,847 --> 00:54:51,836
Sir.

366
00:54:53,216 --> 00:54:55,650
The French have been forced back
on the western side.

367
00:54:56,586 --> 00:54:57,917
They're still holding a perimeter?

368
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,076
For now.

369
00:55:00,657 --> 00:55:02,716
Officer coming through.
Move yourselves. Move yourselves!

370
00:55:13,736 --> 00:55:15,067
Where are the destroyers?

371
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:16,762
There'll be one soon.

372
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:20,865
One?

373
00:55:21,010 --> 00:55:23,604
After yesterday's losses,
it's one ship on the mole at a time.

374
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,838
The battle is here.

375
00:55:25,014 --> 00:55:26,504
What the hell are they saving them for?

376
00:55:26,683 --> 00:55:28,150
The next battle.

377
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:29,785
The one for Britain.

378
00:55:29,953 --> 00:55:31,887
It's the same with the planes.

379
00:55:34,023 --> 00:55:35,650
But it's right there.

380
00:55:36,359 --> 00:55:37,348
You can practically...

381
00:55:37,527 --> 00:55:39,586
Seeing home doesn't help us
get there, Colonel.

382
00:55:39,762 --> 00:55:41,696
They need to send more ships.

383
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,190
Every hour the enemy pushes closer.

384
00:55:45,034 --> 00:55:47,025
They've activated the small vessels pool.

385
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:48,993
Small vessels?

386
00:55:49,172 --> 00:55:51,640
It's the list of civilian boats
for requisition.

387
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,130
Civilian?

388
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,707
We need destroyers.

389
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,643
Small boats can load from the beach.

390
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:00,043
Not in these conditions.

391
00:56:00,216 --> 00:56:02,707
Well, I'd rather face waves
than dive bombers.

392
00:56:05,688 --> 00:56:08,452
No, you're right. They won't get up in this.

393
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:12,556
The Royal Engineers are building piers
from lorries.

394
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:15,357
At least that should help us
when the tide comes back.

395
00:56:15,532 --> 00:56:17,693
Well, we'll know in six hours' time.

396
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:20,134
I thought the tides were every three?

397
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:24,736
Then it's good that you're army
and I'm navy, isn't it?

398
00:56:26,209 --> 00:56:28,507
There. Vanquisher.

399
00:56:43,326 --> 00:56:44,520
Where's the crew?

400
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:46,559
Probably got spooked after they ran aground.

401
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:48,887
Scarpered up the beach.

402
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:50,354
Why?

403
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:53,730
'Cause we're outside the perimeter.
Enemy could be right there.

404
00:56:54,904 --> 00:56:57,338
All right, best shut ourselves inside, boys.

405
00:56:57,507 --> 00:56:58,496
Wait for the high tide.

406
00:56:58,675 --> 00:57:00,233
How long's that?

407
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,037
Every three hours.

408
00:57:25,602 --> 00:57:27,695
I've put a bit of pressure on it.

409
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,804
Strapped him up, made him comfortable.

410
00:57:31,074 --> 00:57:32,098
What?

411
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,399
It's bad, Dad.

412
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:39,904
Well, should we turn back?

413
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:47,278
We've come so far.

414
00:57:48,658 --> 00:57:50,148
Dad, is that one of ours?

415
00:57:51,728 --> 00:57:54,993
That's a Heinkel.
They'll go for that minesweeper there.

416
00:57:55,498 --> 00:57:57,261
Hang on. Shouldn't we stand by
to pick up survivors?

417
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:59,332
To do that we have to survive ourselves.

418
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:06,268
Poke your head out.
See if the water's come in.

419
00:58:11,746 --> 00:58:13,213
Talkative sod, aren't you?

420
00:58:39,341 --> 00:58:41,138
It's barely come in at all.

421
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,470
- Fuck's sake.
- Calm down.

422
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,806
What goes out comes back in again, right?

423
00:58:45,981 --> 00:58:47,380
Yeah, but how long?

424
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:04,988
Spitfires!

425
00:59:05,867 --> 00:59:06,891
Come on.

426
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:14,566
Come on, come on.

427
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:24,682
Dad, he got him!

428
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,411
Yeah! Yeah!

429
00:59:33,762 --> 00:59:35,286
The Heinkel's moving off.

430
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:41,424
Yeah.

431
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:44,060
Oh, no.

432
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,838
Smoke from the Spitfire!

433
00:59:49,177 --> 00:59:51,008
Watch for a parachute!

434
00:59:57,852 --> 00:59:58,841
Oi.

435
01:00:03,858 --> 01:00:05,519
Oi. Oi.

436
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:52,904
Are you German?

437
01:00:53,074 --> 01:00:54,405
No, Dutch. Dutch!

438
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:56,766
Merchant navy.

439
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,102
Here to pick you up. To help you.

440
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,941
Why'd you leave your boat?

441
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,344
In case the Germans come.

442
01:01:02,984 --> 01:01:05,077
We wait up the beach.

443
01:01:05,253 --> 01:01:06,845
With the soldiers. Wait for the tide.

444
01:01:07,022 --> 01:01:09,320
You came back. The tide must be in.

445
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,187
Coming. Coming, yes.

446
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:14,526
But more hours till we float.

447
01:01:14,829 --> 01:01:15,818
Hours?

448
01:01:15,997 --> 01:01:17,464
Why'd you come back?

449
01:01:19,367 --> 01:01:20,527
Not so heavy when I left.

450
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,373
No 'chute!

451
01:01:40,455 --> 01:01:41,444
Best of luck, Collins.

452
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,860
Collins, do you read?

453
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:16,013
He's down.

454
01:02:59,134 --> 01:03:00,123
Dad.

455
01:03:00,301 --> 01:03:01,529
Dad, watch the engine.

456
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,837
Dad, he's down. There was no 'chute.

457
01:03:09,144 --> 01:03:10,475
Dad, come on. There was no 'chute.

458
01:03:11,479 --> 01:03:12,468
He's probably dead.

459
01:03:12,647 --> 01:03:14,808
Damn it, I hear you, Peter! I hear you!

460
01:03:18,153 --> 01:03:19,848
He may be alive. Maybe.

461
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,754
We may be able to help him.

462
01:04:17,345 --> 01:04:19,609
No! Then they'll know we're in here.

463
01:04:19,781 --> 01:04:21,271
Why else are they shooting at us?

464
01:04:21,783 --> 01:04:23,307
Look at the grouping.

465
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:28,622
Target practice.

466
01:05:29,851 --> 01:05:33,252
Go. Plug it. Go, go.

467
01:05:53,474 --> 01:05:54,771
We have to plug it.

468
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,604
After you, mate.

469
01:06:18,666 --> 01:06:20,156
You ready? Go!

470
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:27,330
How do we get off?
Do we need to ditch some ballast?

471
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:29,572
Weight! Do we need to lose weight?

472
01:06:29,744 --> 01:06:31,473
Weight. Weight, yes.

473
01:06:31,646 --> 01:06:32,977
Yes.

474
01:06:33,147 --> 01:06:34,512
Somebody needs to get off.

475
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:36,982
Well volunteered.

476
01:06:37,151 --> 01:06:38,675
We don't need a volunteer.

477
01:06:39,153 --> 01:06:40,780
I know someone who ought to get off.

478
01:06:43,224 --> 01:06:44,213
This one.

479
01:06:45,593 --> 01:06:46,855
He's a German spy.

480
01:06:47,028 --> 01:06:48,427
Don't be daft.

481
01:06:48,596 --> 01:06:50,120
He's a fucking Jerry.

482
01:06:50,999 --> 01:06:53,092
Have you noticed he hasn't said a word?

483
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:55,962
'Cause I have.

484
01:06:56,838 --> 01:06:57,827
He don't speak English.

485
01:06:58,006 --> 01:07:01,169
If he does it's with an accent
that's thicker than sauerkraut sauce.

486
01:07:01,342 --> 01:07:03,037
You're daft. Tell him.

487
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:04,805
Yeah.

488
01:07:08,182 --> 01:07:10,616
Tell me.

489
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:36,972
Tell me, Gibson.

490
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,008
Tell me!

491
01:07:47,088 --> 01:07:48,578
Tell him, for God's sake!

492
01:07:57,432 --> 01:07:59,059
A frog.

493
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,058
A bloody frog.

494
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:04,896
A cowardly little queue-jumping frog.

495
01:08:05,573 --> 01:08:06,938
Who's Gibson, eh?

496
01:08:07,108 --> 01:08:09,576
Some naked, dead Englishman
lying out on that sand?

497
01:08:09,744 --> 01:08:11,769
Did you at least have the decency
to bury him?

498
01:08:12,013 --> 01:08:13,742
He did. I helped him.
I thought it was his mate.

499
01:08:13,948 --> 01:08:15,210
- Maybe he killed him.
- He didn't kill him.

500
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,372
How do we know?

501
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,951
How hard is it to find a dead Englishman
on Dunkirk beach?

502
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,382
He didn't kill anyone.

503
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,682
He was just looking for a way
off the sand, like the rest of us.

504
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:29,858
Haven't they had enough practice by now?

505
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:32,022
They're trying to make sure she won't float.

506
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,690
Will she still float?

507
01:08:33,868 --> 01:08:35,631
Float, yes. Yes, with less weight.

508
01:08:37,305 --> 01:08:38,329
And we know who's getting off.

509
01:08:38,506 --> 01:08:40,633
No, you can't do that.
He's French. He's on our side.

510
01:08:40,808 --> 01:08:42,298
Go on. Up you go.

511
01:08:42,477 --> 01:08:44,741
As soon as he pokes his head out,
they'll slaughter him.

512
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,140
Better him than me.

513
01:08:46,314 --> 01:08:47,474
It's not fair.

514
01:08:47,648 --> 01:08:48,945
Survival's not fair.

515
01:08:49,117 --> 01:08:50,106
No, it's shit.

516
01:08:50,985 --> 01:08:53,317
It's fear, and it's greed.

517
01:08:53,488 --> 01:08:55,479
Fate pushed through the bowels of men.

518
01:08:55,656 --> 01:08:56,645
Shit.

519
01:08:58,159 --> 01:08:59,421
He saved our lives.

520
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:00,822
And he's about to do it again.

521
01:09:00,995 --> 01:09:02,053
No, don't! Stop!

522
01:09:03,397 --> 01:09:06,764
Somebody's gotta get off,
so the rest of us can live.

523
01:09:07,502 --> 01:09:08,526
If you wanna volunteer...

524
01:09:08,736 --> 01:09:09,896
Fuck no.

525
01:09:10,138 --> 01:09:11,127
I'm going home.

526
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,466
And if this is the price?

527
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:19,606
I'll live with it.

528
01:09:20,248 --> 01:09:21,237
But it's wrong.

529
01:09:22,016 --> 01:09:23,005
Go on!

530
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,110
One man's not going to make
enough difference.

531
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:29,347
You'd best hope it does,
because you'd be volunteering next.

532
01:09:30,525 --> 01:09:31,514
What?

533
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:34,294
We're regimental brothers, mate.

534
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:36,294
It's just the way it is.

535
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,672
We float!

536
01:09:48,376 --> 01:09:49,502
We float!

537
01:09:50,211 --> 01:09:51,803
Start the bloody engine!

538
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:31,583
Afternoon.

539
01:11:26,941 --> 01:11:29,307
I'm sorry, son. I really don't know.

540
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:33,742
You're right not moving him.

541
01:11:37,318 --> 01:11:38,808
You've done the best for him you can.

542
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:52,091
We've wasted the day.

543
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,291
I share your frustration, Colonel.

544
01:11:55,836 --> 01:11:56,825
Johnny!

545
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:05,745
Grounded trawler, taking fire.

546
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,939
They're breaking through the dunes
to the east.

547
01:12:11,752 --> 01:12:13,151
This is it.

548
01:12:21,262 --> 01:12:22,320
Plug the holes!

549
01:12:22,496 --> 01:12:23,793
With what?

550
01:12:34,709 --> 01:12:36,609
Plug the holes!

551
01:12:38,346 --> 01:12:41,144
Other side! Other side!

552
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:32,398
What do you see?

553
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:40,604
Home.

554
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:37,180
Is he all right? The boy?

555
01:15:39,193 --> 01:15:40,455
No.

556
01:15:40,628 --> 01:15:42,255
No, he's not.

557
01:15:53,707 --> 01:15:54,696
Dad!

558
01:16:02,583 --> 01:16:04,881
Come on. Come on, Farrier. Come on.

559
01:16:23,871 --> 01:16:25,429
There's men in the water!

560
01:17:10,784 --> 01:17:11,773
Oil.

561
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:15,744
It's oil. Oil. You're getting into oil!

562
01:17:51,191 --> 01:17:52,658
Keep coming.

563
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:54,993
Plenty of room.

564
01:18:00,034 --> 01:18:01,831
All right, below deck.

565
01:18:37,905 --> 01:18:39,805
Abandon ship!

566
01:19:02,062 --> 01:19:04,360
Gibson! Leave it!

567
01:19:47,374 --> 01:19:48,534
Below decks.

568
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:39,618
Listen, we have to get as many
of you on board as we can

569
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,885
before that oil catches fire.

570
01:20:41,094 --> 01:20:43,688
You go below decks or you get
off my boat. That's your choice.

571
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:48,362
Keep coming.

572
01:20:49,703 --> 01:20:52,194
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Careful! Careful down there!

573
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:53,669
Careful! Careful down there!

574
01:20:55,709 --> 01:20:57,836
He's dead, mate.

575
01:21:02,449 --> 01:21:04,542
So be bloody careful with him.

576
01:21:26,573 --> 01:21:28,234
Um, will he be okay?

577
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,067
The boy?

578
01:21:36,049 --> 01:21:37,038
Yeah.

579
01:23:00,801 --> 01:23:02,564
He's coming back round.

580
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:04,734
He's coming back round!

581
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,510
Come on, Farrier. Come on.

582
01:23:27,761 --> 01:23:28,989
Get off the ship!

583
01:23:45,178 --> 01:23:46,645
Come on, Farrier. Get around them.

584
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:48,110
Come on, come on.

585
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:45,760
Go.

586
01:24:50,277 --> 01:24:51,266
Go! Go! Go!

587
01:25:05,692 --> 01:25:06,750
Go!

588
01:25:40,527 --> 01:25:41,516
Easy.

589
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:47,928
Take me home.

590
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,122
Where are you from?

591
01:26:48,028 --> 01:26:49,825
Out of Dartmouth!

592
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,224
Christ.

593
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:53,663
You from Deal?

594
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:55,300
I am!

595
01:26:55,468 --> 01:26:57,595
You watch the current at the mouth!

596
01:26:57,804 --> 01:26:58,793
Aye.

597
01:26:58,972 --> 01:27:00,030
And thank you!

598
01:27:49,856 --> 01:27:50,880
That's a fighter.

599
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:52,217
Yes, an Me 109.

600
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:54,053
From the south. Peter, you take the tiller.

601
01:27:54,561 --> 01:27:56,392
Listen for my instructions.

602
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,424
Point her south!

603
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:12,066
Full speed, Peter.

604
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:15,948
Keep coming round.

605
01:28:16,116 --> 01:28:17,310
Keep coming.

606
01:28:18,652 --> 01:28:22,315
Before he fires, he's gotta
drop his nose. I'll give you the signal.

607
01:28:23,823 --> 01:28:25,051
- Now?
- No, no. Wait.

608
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:28,284
Wait for him to commit to his line.

609
01:28:45,512 --> 01:28:46,570
Now!

610
01:29:24,784 --> 01:29:25,773
He's gone.

611
01:29:25,885 --> 01:29:27,216
Yeah, bigger fish to fry.

612
01:29:27,387 --> 01:29:29,287
How'd you know that stuff, anyway?

613
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:30,883
My son's one of you lot.

614
01:29:31,691 --> 01:29:33,386
I knew he'd see us through.

615
01:29:39,466 --> 01:29:40,455
You're RAF?

616
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:44,367
No. Not me.

617
01:29:44,537 --> 01:29:47,870
My brother. He flew Hurricanes.

618
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:49,633
Died third week into the war.

619
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:31,942
No, stay downstairs, please.

620
01:30:32,585 --> 01:30:34,576
We just wanna see the cliffs.

621
01:30:41,528 --> 01:30:43,428
- Is it Dover?
- No.

622
01:30:43,997 --> 01:30:45,430
That's Dorset.

623
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:47,557
But it's home.

624
01:30:49,569 --> 01:30:52,003
We let you all down, didn't we?

625
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:34,211
Christ, how many you got in there?

626
01:31:52,232 --> 01:31:53,859
Make your way to the trains.

627
01:31:55,535 --> 01:31:57,127
Where the hell were you?

628
01:32:04,544 --> 01:32:06,239
They know where you were.

629
01:32:11,518 --> 01:32:12,507
Bye.

630
01:32:32,338 --> 01:32:33,703
Cup of tea?

631
01:32:35,642 --> 01:32:37,007
Cup of tea?

632
01:32:37,844 --> 01:32:40,574
Well done. Well done.

633
01:32:41,014 --> 01:32:42,140
Well done, lads.

634
01:32:42,282 --> 01:32:44,910
Well done. Well done, lads.

635
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:47,577
Well done.

636
01:32:48,187 --> 01:32:49,848
All we did is survive.

637
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,922
That's enough.

638
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:00,688
Well done.

639
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:03,165
Well done.

640
01:33:14,314 --> 01:33:16,782
That old bloke wouldn't even
look us in the eye.

641
01:33:37,136 --> 01:33:39,070
Come on, private!

642
01:33:39,973 --> 01:33:44,569
I know we're officers,
but it's us or the enemy.

643
01:33:45,645 --> 01:33:47,977
So now is not the time to be particular.

644
01:33:51,618 --> 01:33:54,246
Well, Churchill got his 30,000.

645
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:55,717
And then some.

646
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,648
Almost 300,000.

647
01:34:02,095 --> 01:34:03,323
So far.

648
01:34:04,731 --> 01:34:05,755
So far?

649
01:34:06,299 --> 01:34:07,527
I'm staying.

650
01:34:08,735 --> 01:34:10,100
For the French.

651
01:35:03,723 --> 01:35:05,122
Hey!

652
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:06,451
Where are we?

653
01:35:06,592 --> 01:35:09,390
Siding. You'll be pulling in in a minute.

654
01:35:09,562 --> 01:35:11,029
What station?

655
01:35:11,197 --> 01:35:12,687
Woking.

656
01:35:13,332 --> 01:35:14,959
Grab me one of them papers.

657
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:16,327
Go on!

658
01:35:30,183 --> 01:35:31,582
Can't bear it.

659
01:35:33,419 --> 01:35:34,579
You read it.

660
01:35:35,388 --> 01:35:36,377
Can't bear it?

661
01:35:37,023 --> 01:35:39,218
They'll be spitting at us in the streets.

662
01:35:40,259 --> 01:35:43,092
If they're not locked up
waiting for the invasion.

663
01:36:29,642 --> 01:36:32,110
"Wars are not won by evacuations."

664
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:37,246
I can't look.

665
01:36:37,617 --> 01:36:41,617
"But there was a victory inside this
deliverance, which should be noted.

666
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:50,495
"Our thankfulness at the escape of our army

667
01:36:50,663 --> 01:36:53,097
"must not blind us to the fact
that what has happened

668
01:36:53,266 --> 01:36:56,827
"in France and Belgium
is a colossal military disaster.

669
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:17,753
"We must expect another blow
to be struck almost immediately.
